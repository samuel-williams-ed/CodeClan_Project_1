Fantasy Shop Inventory

Build an app which allows a shopkeeper to track their shop's inventory. This is not an app which the customer will see, it is an admin/management app for the shop workers.

Style & theme: 
- Based on the early, fantasy-action-adventure, hand-held console games of the 1990's. 
 - Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX (1998, colour version of the 1993 game)

MVP

The inventory should track
- id (generated by SQL)
- name (input || or taken from product_object?)
- description (taken from product_object)
- stock quantity (input & function)
- buying cost (from manufacturer_object)
- selling price (input & function)
- item category/ object (armour, ranged, magical, close-combat, util) (taken from product_object)

Classes:
- Product
- Combat_stats
- Inventory_item
- Manufacturer 

* class Inventory_holding
 - id
 <!-- name can be a plumped up version of the wholesellers name -->
 - name 
 - number_in_stock
 - retail_price
 - Product (object)
 - Manufacturer (object)

 * class Product()
 - id
 - name
 - description
 - magical_item (y/n)
 - combat_strength

 * class Manufacturer
 - id 
 - manufacturer_name
 - wholesale_cost
 - delivery_fee


maybe:
- combat strength
- magical? Boolean
- Mage level required to handle (if required)

The inventory should track
- manufacturers
- name 
- any other

The shop can sell anything you like
should be able
- create
- edit manufacturers
- edit products

Shop should find items by:
- name
- buying cost
- selling cost
- category

shop should filter by:
- in stock
- price
- category


This might mean that it makes more sense for a car shop to track makes and models of cars. Or a bookstore might sell books by author, or by publisher, and not by manufacturer. You are free to name classes and tables as appropriate to your project.
Show an inventory page, listing all the details for all the products in stock in a single view.
As well as showing stock quantity as a number, the app should visually highlight "low stock" and "out of stock" items to the user.

Shop Inventory

Build an app which allows a shopkeeper to track their shop's inventory. This is not an app which the customer will see, it is an admin/management app for the shop workers.

MVP

The inventory should track individual products, including a name, description, stock quantity, buying cost, and selling price.
The inventory should track manufacturers, including a name and any other appropriate details.
The shop can sell anything you like, but you should be able to create and edit manufacturers and products separately.
